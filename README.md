This project models blackjack using Monte Carlo simulation with a
realistic multi-deck shoe, card depletion, and penetration-based reshuffling.

## Key Features
- Persistent 6-deck shoe modeling
- Dynamic bust probability calculation
- Strategy parameterization (hit thresholds)
- Monte Carlo simulation with EV and variance
- Risk-adjusted return metrics
- Interactive manual play mode

## Why This Project
The simulation evolved from independent hands to a state-dependent system,
highlighting how probability distributions change when a system has memory.

This mirrors concepts used in risk modeling, trading systems, and simulation
engineering.

## Technologies
- Python
- JupyterLab
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Probability modeling

## Future Extensions
- Card counting strategies
- Strategy optimization
- Visualization of probability shifts
- Web-based interface
